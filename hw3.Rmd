## Chapter 10

### Q8
In Section 10.2.3, a formula for calculating PVE was given in Equa- tion 10.8. We also saw that the PVE can be obtained using the `sdev` output of the `prcomp()` function.

On the USArrests data, calculate PVE in two ways:

**(a)** Using the sdev output of the prcomp() function, as was done in
Section 10.2.3.



**(b)** By applying Equation 10.8 directly. That is, use the prcomp() function to compute the principal component loadings. Then, use those loadings in Equation 10.8 to obtain the PVE.
